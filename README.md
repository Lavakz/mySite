# mySite

This website is meant to be a portfolio of some of my work.

It contains a simulation of a rubiks cube and a racing game I created with a partner in a computer graphics class.
There is also a music player to showcase some of my original compositions. 
I created the music player by combining the music visualizer ButterChurn with the media player APlayer.
